% 
%  outputs: the shape struct that has the target shapes vs time 
%
%     (rb.Data, rb.Time) - R position of boundary target shape, 
%                          timebase for R position of boundary target shape
%
%     (zb.Data, zb.Time)         - Z position of boundary target shape
%     (rx.Data, rx.Time)         - R position of target x-point
%     (zx.Data, zx.Time)         - Z position of target x-point
%     (rtouch.Data, rtouch.Time) - R position of target touch point
%     (ztouch.Data, ztouch.Time) - Z position of target touch point
%     (rbdef.Data, rbdef.Time)   - R of point where boundary flux (psibry)
%                                    is evaluated
%     (zbdef.Data, zbdef.Time)   - Z of " " "
%
%     Note that each of these can use different timebases which are later
%     interpolated. Each quantity should be defined at each time, but will 
%     only enter the optimization depending on the optimization weights.
